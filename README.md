A collection of standalone programs that were created with github co-pilot, and less than 10% user intervention.



## Things It's good at
* Will often auto-suggest the next function you need to write
* Will often correctly write entire functions by itself
*
*



## Things it's not so good at
* Can suggest code written in out-dated technologies, or technologies that you are not using:
EG suggesting JQuery syntax in a non-Jquery project.
* Can sometimes get stuck in a feedback loop where it repeats its suggestions until you tell it otherwise
*
*
