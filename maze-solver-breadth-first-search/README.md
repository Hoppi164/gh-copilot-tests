This is a simple maze solving algoritm that was 90% written using github co-pilot.
I struggled to handwrite a similar program a few years ago, but today github can write it for me..


> You can paste the test.js file contents directly into your browser console and play the game yourself.


The maze is setup very simply with a straight line of '1' characters which can be walked on. 
with a few side corridors

This figure shows that although it is a straight line, the program is performing a bredth first search to determine the most ideal path to the endpoint

Try adjusting the maze layout, and the start/end co-ordinates
