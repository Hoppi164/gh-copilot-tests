######This program will allow a player to choose 2 pokemon, to have an imaginary battle, and program will tell us which pokemon would win.

This is a simple program with the goal of testing co-pilots understanding of api's and promises.

> I've included screenshots of the process below to highlight how much was written by me, and how much was written by co-pilot.
**My contributions** are mostly **comments, function names**, and ocasional bug fixes.
Everything you see in **grey text** below is code suggestions **by co-pilot**.

Notes:

* Phrasing is everything!
Co-pilot kept suggesting code that uses Jquery, when i wanted to to use the modern "Fetch" method

Changing a few words completely changed the output. This one returns the modern, promise based output i was expecting
